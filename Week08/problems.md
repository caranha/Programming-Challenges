==============================

8 problems:

# Example problems
10523 - Very Easy !!! (1464 -- very small numbers in description)
10925 - Krakovia (1866 - Just use BigInt)
10139 - Factorvisors (1080 -- see if one set contains another)

# Big num 2 (easy and med)
10083 - Division (1024 -- some special cases (t=1, a=b, etc))
343 - What Base Is This? (279 -- Try all bases)

# Primality 1 (med-hard)

(If a number N has prime factors: a^ixb^jxc^k..., the total number of
 divisors is: (i+1)x(j+1)x(k+1)...)
