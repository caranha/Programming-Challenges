# TODO:
- [ ] This lecture needs major restructuring -- Remake this lecture based on
      CP4

# Future
- [ ] In combinatorics, add example problem: Steps
- [ ] Future topics (from Halim's book) Cycle finding, Game Theory
- [ ] Check TODO inside the file.

# Lecture Outline: Week 08: Mathematics
General Topics:
- Number Theory
- Diaphantyne equation, primes, factorization
- Combinatorics

Add algorithms from the books

## Diaphantyne equation:
- Algorithm is not explained, explain logic behind algorithm
  and how it works
- Give a more careful example
- Get inspiration from Maths for CS lecture

## Combinatorics
- Fold the "ad hoc" combinatorics section into a combinatorics
  section.
- "Sequences" subsection
  - Recurrence and closed form
  - For each example, start with the numbers of the sequence,
    solve the recurrence OR closed form together with students
  - Focus on sequences with computational meanings
- Motivating example: Triangle numbers (1,3,6,10,15,16)
- Closed forms and recurrence
  - In programming challenges: What is the N-th value,
    what is the first or last value with Y property (size, something else)
- Further examples:
    Binomial Sequence, Catalan Sequence, Fibonacci
- Example Problem:
    Steps
