# TODO
- [ ] There are several textual errors:
  - Explanation of weights in "graph transformation" is wrong
  - Part II is "All parts Shortest paths", not "all pairs"
  - Go slowly over the slide to fix these errors.

- [ ] Change Lecture break:
  - Negative Cycle djikstra goes to APSP part
  - APSP part renamed to "special cases of path searching"

- [ ] 1st example of Bellman Ford should include a 
  non-negative cycle graph

- [ ] Dijkstra PQ simulation image replaced with separate 
  images.
  
- [ ] Extra section: "It does not look like flow, but it's flow!"
  
- [ ] Add graph animation for Ford-Fulkerson

- [ ] Add more detailed code for Edmond-carp;

- [ ] Add code for Graph problem examples section;
