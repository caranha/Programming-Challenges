Week 4 - Dynamic Programming 2
==============================

# Sample problems
10943 - How do you add (Book)

# TSP
10496 - Collecting Beepers -- TSP, Manhattan Distance;
11284 - Shopping Trip - TSP with option of not visiting certain cities;
        At each step, we have one more option: go home early;
10721 - Bar Codes
10003 - Cutting Strings - 944 (DP discussed in class, easy)
1261 - String Popping (3702) - top down DP with set(string) to store state

10036 - Divisibility: (977) - Add/subtract numbers (N < 10000) to divide by K.
        state: (i, modk), which modules we can reach at each state (+,-)
	bad state (i, comb(N)) - too many N

(1851) - Marks distribution (sum, same as how do you add)

(2402) - Squares (memoization/recursive of squares to sum to a number)
