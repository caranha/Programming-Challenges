DP 2 -- Remix Class
===================

# Future TODO
- Add discussion/problem about Meet In The Middle (MITM)

# lecture Preparation
## Grades Summary, Final Deadline
## DP on Graph -- Implicit graph and TSP
## Special DPs -- Cutting Sticks and Free Parenthesis


# Problems
- 10937 -- Blackbeard the Pirate (1878) -- TSP with implicit graph, page 323
- 10003 -- Cutting sticks (944) -- DP on the cutting position, page 113
- 1238  -- Free Parenthesis (3679) -- DP with negative indices, page 313
- 1231  -- ACORN (3672) -- DP with tricky states (Current tree is not needed as state), page 315
- 714   -- Copying Books (655) -- Binary search with greedy algorithm (or DP), page 328  
- 10012 -- How big is it? (953) -- Complete search with geometry
- 295   -- Fatman (231) -- Binary search + Graph + Geometry: Decide the size of the man, then 
           connect all points under that distance + walls. If walls are connected, cannot pass.
- 1079  -- A careful approach (3520) -- Full search of airplane orders, followed by 
           binary search of largest gap, powered by greedy allocation of gaps
	   (possibly pruning, but not necessary?)
