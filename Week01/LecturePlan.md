# Week 0 - Introduction and Adhoc
- What are the goals of this course?
- What is a programming challenge, and why it is important to study it.
- What are the rules of the course (submission, grading)
- General principles when solving programming challenges.

# Details
## What are the goals of this course?
In this course, the students will solve small programming challenges,
where they must use their knowledge of algorithms and programming.
The objective of the course is to practice programming solving
skills, implementation skills, and algorithm knowledge:

- Program solving skills: To understand what is asked
- Implementation skills: Debuging, creating test cases, etc
- Algorithm knowledge: to know what is a good algorithm for each problem.

## What is a programming challenge, and why is it important?
-

## What are the rules of the course
- The Online Judge, how to submit, and check your submission
- Submission status and their meanings, and how to deal with them
- Submission rules, deadline rules and grading rules

## General Principles when solving programming challenges
- Reading the text and understanding what is required
- Inputs, Outputs. Memory and Time cost.

## Final notes about this course
- Where to find reference materials: Manaba, Github, books
- English and Japanese: (Google translate, e-mails, etc)
- Calendar
- ICPC
- Programming time: solving problems, asking questions, and leaving early.

# TODO:
- Reorder lectures based on the plan above
- Reduce the blabla in part four, leave only one trivial problem.
- Add a more interesting problem at the end of this class (8-queen?)
