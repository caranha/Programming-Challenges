Week 1: Introduction and AdHoc Problems
=======================================

# Outline
In the first week, the problems are very
easy, so you can practice the style of
problems, and how to use an automated judge.

In this lecture, I want to give you some
hints that will be useful for the entire course.

# Thinking, testing by hand, then coding
- Think first, and then program, this helps avoid bugs.

- Google Translate or DeepL helps
- Looking for keywords also helps

# Problem Size and algorithm analysis (1.3.3)
- When thinking about the problem, we need to think about problem size.

- Example 1: 3n+1 problem and problem size
- Example 2: 8 queen and data size

- Table of algorithm analysis (beware of new server!)

# Writing test Cases (1.3.5)
- extend the basic cases
- write "extreme cases" (max case, etc)
- write cases where you think a bug might be
- write random cases

# Dealing with IO
## Standard IO Types (https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code/tree/master/ch1/ch1IO.cpp)

# TODO: In 2023!
## Basic String Skills(https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code/tree/master/ch1/basic_string.cpp)

## Be careful of output:
- Case
- Number of decimal places: Round up or down
- Tie breakers

# How to ask for help



# Lecture Contents
## Outline/Goals
- What are the goals of this course?
- What is a programming challenge, and why it is important to study it.
- What are the rules of the course (submission, grading)
- General principles when solving programming challenges.

## Details
### What are the goals of this course?
In this course, the students will solve small programming challenges, where they must use their knowledge of algorithms and programming. The objective of the course is to practice programming solving skills, implementation skills, and algorithm knowledge:

- Program solving skills: To understand what is asked
- Implementation skills: Debugging, creating test cases, etc
- Algorithm knowledge: to know what is a good algorithm for each problem.

### What are the rules of the course
- The Online Judge, how to submit, and check your submission
- Submission status and their meanings, and how to deal with them
- Submission rules, deadline rules and grading rules

### General Principles when solving programming challenges
- Reading the text and understanding what is required
- Inputs, Outputs. Memory and Time cost.

### Other Notes about this course
- Where to find reference materials: Manaba, Github, books
- Languages of the course (natural and programming)
- Lecture calendar and office hours
- ICPC Invitation
