## This Year 2020

## Javascript monitor:
- [ ] Add the number of times a student submitted each problem
      (total submissions / submissions before accepted)
- [ ] Add a "Number of students that solved X problems" for each week
- [ ] Add a "Solutions/Submissions" per language per problem.
- [ ] Add a view of "top students" (total submissions, and penalty score)
- [ ] Add a final report mode for teacher
- [ ] Try to add again the "save to local storage" option

## Week 4: DP
- [X] Fix new slides for DP
- [X] Improve explanation of "Classical DP Problems"
- [X] Add code for full search in motivating problem.
- [ ] (Future): Add Flight Planner example (maybe add to problems)
- [ ] (Future): Is RangeSum really DP? maybe should go to maths?
- [ ] (Future): Include TSP DP back to the lecture.

## Future
### Week 5: Graph Part I
- Include more examples and discussions on the
  "common algorithms" part in the middle section.

### Week 6: Graph Part II
- Lecture is generally good, but need more graph
  images showing the progress of the algorithm step by step.

### Week 7: String Manipulation
- Add Z algorithm for substring matching

### Week 8: Mathematics
- Needs improvement
  -- Fold the "ad hoc" (combinatorics) to combinatorics subsection.
  -- Add some algorithms from the books.
  -- Add more examples.

### Week 9: Computational Geometry
- Overall good lecture -- See local TODO for suggested improvements


## 2021
- [ ] Remake videos using scripts
## Week 3: Search
- [ ] Add example on permutation search with bitmask (cinema sitting problem)
- [ ] Add slide explaining LIS solution with Greedy
