# General

## Javascript monitor:
- [ ] Add the number of times a student submitted each problem
      (total submissions / submissions before accepted)
- [ ] Add a view of "top students" (total submissions, and penalty score)
- [ ] Add a final report mode for teacher
- [ ] Try to add again the "save to local storage" option


### Week 3: Search
- Add bitmask paired with permutation search
- Add Lecture Plan
- Need More examples for D&C and Greedy

### Week 4: DP
- DP week one was OK.
- DP week two needs more figures for the "classical DP problems",
  including explicit tables to show what is happening to the students.

### Week 5: Graph Part I
- Include more examples and discussions on the
  "common algorithms" part in the middle section.

### Week 6: Graph Part II
- Lecture is generally good, but need more graph
  images showing the progress of the algorithm step by step.

### Week 7: String Manipulation
- Add Z algorithm for substring matching

### Week 8: Mathematics
- Needs improvement
  -- Fold the "ad hoc" (combinatorics) to combinatorics subsection.
  -- Add some algorithms from the books.
  -- Add more examples.

### Week 9: Computational Geometry
- Overall good lecture -- See local TODO for suggested improvements
