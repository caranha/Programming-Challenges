# General
- Add kbd course description as a file.

### Week 1:
- Course Introduction
- Course Requirements
- Ad hoc problems

### Week 2: Data Structures
- Students found "Army Buddies" example difficult to follow...
- Add Fenwick Tree?
- Improve section about queues/stacks/Libraries
- Add better motivating problem for bitmask (maybe move bitmask to search week
  and pair with permutation?)

### Week 3: Search
- Add Lecture Plan
- Need More examples for D&C and Greedy

### Week 4: DP
- DP week one was OK.
- DP week two needs more figures for the "classical DP problems",
  including explicit tables to show what is happening to the students.

### Week 5: Graph Part I
- Include more examples and discussions on the
  "common algorithms" part in the middle section.

### Week 6: Graph Part II
- Lecture is generally good, but need more graph
  images showing the progress of the algorithm step by step.

### Week 7: String Manipulation
- Add Z algorithm for substring matching

### Week 8: Mathematics
- Needs improvement
  -- Fold the "ad hoc" (combinatorics) to combinatorics subsection.
  -- Add some algorithms from the books.
  -- Add more examples.

### Week 9: Computational Geometry
- Overall good lecture -- See local TODO for suggested improvements

## Monitor Javascript
- Add a list of "top students", with ICPC-like solved+penalty score
- Add ranking of students (total / in grade group)
- Add final report for teacher
