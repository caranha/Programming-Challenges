= Ideas for improving the course

== General

**New problem discussion format**:  
At each class B. For each problem, explain the problem,
then let a volunteer student explain a solution (or candidate solution). One student cannot
explain more than one problem unless.  
If no student volunteer, give some hints but do not solve the problem. Give more detailed
hints if a student volunteers with an incomplete answer.

== Monitor.js
* Add a query for "students who solved 0, 1, 2, 3, 4+ problems
* Add a query for "students who tried 0, 1, 2, 3, 4+ problems
* Separate query functions from draw functions
* Student query -- make a summary for each week at the bottom: tried/submitted/submitted late

== For each class
Do not forget the TODO file in each class

=== Week 0
* Rename week to "Ad Hoc Problems"
* Add "memoization techniques" to 3n+1 Discussion  

=== Week 1
* Add more examples/code for class A.
* Class B was good in 2016
