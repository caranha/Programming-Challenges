# Ideas for improving the course

## Per Week improvement
- Write a Lecture Plan for every Week

### Week 0: Ad Hoc Problems (introduction)
- Rename to "Ad Hoc Problems"
- Explicitely Mention memoization techniques (which will be renamed top down DP later)
- Rewrite Week0B -- More example, less trivial information
- Remove some trivial problems (only 1 trivial problem)

### Week 1: Data Structures
- Move Jolly Jumpers to Week 0
- Remove CD problem, replace with a more interesting "map/set" problem
- Add Segment Tree and Fenwick tree
- Add problem sample with queues and Stacks

### Week 2: Search
- Add Lecture Plan

### Week 3: DP
- DP week one was OK.
- DP week two needs more figures for the "classical DP problems", including explicit tables to show what 
  is happening to the students.

### Week 4: Graph Part I AB
- Materials need more examples and discussion in the middle section (Common Algorithms) for 2019

### Week 5: Graph Part II AB
- Lecture is generally good, but need more graph images showing the progress of the algorithm step by step.

### Week 6: Mathematics 
- BAD LECTURE -- NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!

### Week 7: Geometry
- Overall good lecture -- See TODO for suggested improvements

## Improve Monitor.js
- On page load, monitor queries each student for all their solved problems, 
  and stores solved entries, earliest solve time. To avoid having to reload for each student query, and each
  week query.
  
- Add a list of "top students", with ICPC-like solved+penalty score
