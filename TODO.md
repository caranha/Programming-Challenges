# Ideas for improving the course
- Make Lecture Plan for every Week



### Week 1: Data Structures
- Students found "Army Buddies" example difficult to follow...
- Add Fenwick Tree?
- Improve section about queues/stacks/Libraries
- Add better motivating problem for bitmask (maybe move bitmask to search week
  and pair with permutation?)

### Week 2: Search
- Add Lecture Plan
- Need More examples for D&C and Greedy

### Week 3: DP
- DP week one was OK.
- DP week two needs more figures for the "classical DP problems",
  including explicit tables to show what is happening to the students.

### Week 4: Graph Part I
- Include more examples and discussions on the
  "common algorithms" part in the middle section.

### Week 5: Graph Part II
- Lecture is generally good, but need more graph
  images showing the progress of the algorithm step by step.

### Week 6: Mathematics
- BAD LECTURE -- NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!
  -- Fold the "ad hoc" (combinatorics) to combinatorics subsection.
  -- Add some algorithms from the books.
  -- Add more examples.

### Week 7: Geometry
- Overall good lecture -- See TODO for suggested improvements

## Improve Monitor.js
- On page load, monitor queries each student for all their solved problems,
  and stores solved entries, earliest solve time. To avoid having to reload for each student query, and each
  week query.

- Add a list of "top students", with ICPC-like solved+penalty score
