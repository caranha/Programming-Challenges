# Ideas for improving the course
- Make Lecture Plan for every Week

### Week 0: Ad Hoc Problems (introduction)
- Add one more problem analysis to 0B and reduce blablabla.
- Leave only one trivial problem, and add something more interesting (easy 8-queen?)

### Week 1: Data Structures
- Students found "Army Buddies" example difficult to follow...
- Add Fenwick Tree?
- Improve section about queues/stacks/Libraries
- Add better motivating problem for bitmask (maybe move bitmask to search week
  and pair with permutation?)

### Week 2: Search
- Add Lecture Plan
- Slides are mostly ok (maybe more images?)

### Week 3: DP
- DP week one was OK.
- DP week two needs more figures for the "classical DP problems", including explicit tables to show what
  is happening to the students.

### Week 4: Graph Part I AB
- Materials need more examples and discussion in the middle section (Common Algorithms) for 2019

### Week 5: Graph Part II AB
- Lecture is generally good, but need more graph images showing the progress of the algorithm step by step.

### Week 6: Mathematics
- BAD LECTURE -- NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!

### Week 7: Geometry
- Overall good lecture -- See TODO for suggested improvements

## Improve Monitor.js
- On page load, monitor queries each student for all their solved problems,
  and stores solved entries, earliest solve time. To avoid having to reload for each student query, and each
  week query.

- Add a list of "top students", with ICPC-like solved+penalty score
