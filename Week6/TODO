- Improve the "Diaphantyne equation" section and the "Sequences" section
- Both topics have been covered in more detail in the "Maths for CS" lecture

- Diaphantyne equation:
  - The algorithm is not explained - explain the logic behind the algorithm, and how this works
  - Give a more careful example

- Combinatorics
  - For each example, start with the numbers of the sequence, then solve the recurrence 
    together/closed form together with students.
  - First example: Triangle numbers (1,3,6,10,15,16)
  - Explain what is Closed form and Recurrence.
  - Questions in programming challenges: What is the N-th value? What is the first/last value with Y property?
  - Second example: Binomial Combination
  - Third example: Catalan numbers
  - Fourth example: Fibonacci

  - Example problem: Steps
