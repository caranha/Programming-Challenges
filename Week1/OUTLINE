Outline for Class 1-2




- The skill of "problem solving" (We are going to improve programming, but this is important too)
-- How to read a problem 
-- Writing down an "idea" of the problem (mathematical, visual) as you read
-- Identify inputs, outputs, and problem spots
-- Identify parts of the problem that are not important

- Debugging a problem
-- Ad hoc programs are good to start learning good debugging practices
-- They usually are very burdensome problems


- How selecting the right data structure changes the problem
-- Towers of Hanoi as List (Recursive)
-- Towers of Hanoi as Adjacency Graph (Search)

- Simple description of the problems
