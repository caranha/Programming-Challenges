  \begin{block}{Submission with Java}
    Two students had \structure{``runtime error''} with Java last week
    -- don't forget that your start class MUST be called {\bf Main}.
  \end{block}

  \vfill

\begin{verbatim}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // do something...

  }
}
\end{verbatim}

  \begin{block}{Input/Output}
    Two other students had problems because their program printed ``Please enter a number''.

    \bigskip

    You are very kind, but please {\bf follow the specifications} strictly!
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Format for MANABA submission}
    One student asked if the code for MANABA had to be the same as the code for UVA.

    \bigskip

    Yes. The code you submit on MANABA must be {\bf exactly the same}
    as the code you submitted for UVA.

  \frametitle{More about input...}

  Do not enter the input by hand! Create an input file, and run your
  program with the input file to save time and get more precise
  results.

  \bigskip

  \begin{block}{}
\begin{verbatim}
$ cat - > input.in
1 10
10 1
10 10 
$ g++ 100.cpp
$ ./a.out < input.in
1 10 20
10 1 20
10 10 7
\end{verbatim}
  \end{block}

  \frametitle{Short comments about the problems:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cost Cutting, Event Planning, Horror Dash -- Easiest problems (find mean, find min, find min);
    \bigskip

  \item 3n+1 -- Still easy, but a few traps -- you may need to use
    {\bf Memoization} to get under the time limit;
    \bigskip

  \item Y3K Problem -- Still easy, but skip year can be a bit troublesome.
