-> Primes: 
Remember that if you divide the board in black and white, you 
are solving two problems with half the size. What is the solution
to the two problems half the size? (a*b)

-> Primes:
* Naive approach 1: (n^4)
* Naive approach 2: (n^3) (find three numbers, subtract from n

Golbach Conjecture: Every even number is a sum of two primes:
- 4 and 5 have two primes each. Subtract them from "n", and find the remaining primes
- Now you just need to find one more prime
- are more optimizations necessary?

-> Garden of Eden:
* Celular automata may be hard to understand, explain that first
- Naive solution: Try to find the immediate ancestor
Define the first element, then the next, then the next, with simple backtracking.
- Is there a more intelligent approach? (list of possible states? Two way backtracking?)

-> Colour Hash
- Explain the problem (calculate steps 1,2,3,4 - you only have 16 steps: 16^4 = 2^16: quite big)
- Pruning: What is it: For example, you don't want to do reverse moves!
- Put all visited position in a hash table, to avoid visiting a position twice (how do you hash this?)
- Start from the final position and caching steps? (try not to consume too much memory!)
