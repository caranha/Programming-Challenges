\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The choice of data structure and its implementation has great influence in the algorithm used to solve a programming challenge.
    \bigskip

    \item It is important to be familiar with the main data structures of your programming language (arrays, matrices), and their utility functions.\bigskip

    \item For those structures not available in the library, I recommend that you create a "library" of code you have created. It will come in handy time and time again in your career!
