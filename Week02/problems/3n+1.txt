 The 3n + 1 problem

Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1. For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:
22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
It is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at n = 1 for every integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least 1, 000, 000.

For an input n, the cycle-length of n is the number of numbers generated up to and including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two numbers i and j, you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j, including both endpoints.

Input
The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and j, one pair of integers per line. All integers will be less than 1,000,000 and greater than 0.

Output
For each pair of input integers i and j, output i, j in the same order in which they appeared in the input and then the maximum cycle length for integers between and including i and j. These three numbers should be separated by one space, with all three numbers on one line and with one line of output for each line of input.
