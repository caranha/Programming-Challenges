# Slide Materials
=====
# Video 1: Motivation (2.1)
TODO: Add a motivating example of using a good data structure solve a kattis problem.

# Video 2: Linear Data Structures (2.2)
TODO: Add implementation code of bucket sort

## Video 3: Non Linear Data Structures (2.3)
TODO: Add Explanation about "Order Statistic Tree" (rest of section 2.3)?
TODO: Beef this video with one example from kattis?

## TODO: Video 3.5 Bitmask
- Array of boolean: Learn how to use a *bitmask*: Treat an unsigned integer as binary array. This can be useful when you want to use a bitmask as an index for an array
(we will see an example of this when we study TSP later in this course) (2.2.3, link code)


# Video 3: UFDS (2.4.x)
TODO: Improve the motivating problem (get a problem from kattis, and include the solution here)

# TODO: Video 4: Segment Tree (2.4.x)
