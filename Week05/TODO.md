## Problems
- [ ] Check Problems (Week 5 and 6)
- [ ] Update Problems on Github
- [ ] Update Problems on Manaba

## Class Improvements
- Start: Talk about possible graph problems
    - Test if a node belongs to a graph or not
    - Test the shortest path between A and B
    - Test the cheapest, or the most expensive path
    - Test if there is more than one path between A and B
    - Test multiple paths between multiple nodes
- Let's start with one example problem: Dominator
    - Get the students to propose a solution
    - Show the solution: One DFS, then remove each node and run again

- Graph Data Structures
  - Cost in graphs problems
      - Perform a DFS or BFS
      - Visit all edges in a node
      - Delete a node
      - Add a new node or edge to a graph
  - Each data structure should have a code snipped and discussion
        on the cost of: visiting, adding, removing, listing neighbors

  - Many of Graph problems depend on DFS and BFS
      - simple explanation
      - simple code (Remake code to use the same base data structure)
      - What is the cost of DFS and BFS?

  - Graph Classical Problems
      - Explain different concepts more slowly
        - Problem Example
        - Graph Example (Animation)
        - Code Example (of algorithm)
