\subsection{Class Objective}
\begin{frame}{Class Objective}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Course Objective: \alert{Improve your algorithm skill by writing many programs};
    \bigskip

    \item \alert{Key Idea:} Write programs that solve challenges (puzzles)
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Read the problem and understand the puzzle;
      \item Choose the algorithm and implement;
      \item Run the program and check the correct result;
      \item Repeat many times
    \end{enumerate}
    \medskip

    \item In this lecture, we want to \alert{use in practice} the algorithms that we
    learned in the 1st and 2nd year.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Algorithms: Theory vs. Implementation}
  \begin{exampleblock}{}
    When we implement an algorithm in a hard program we learn many things:
  \end{exampleblock}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Input/Output}: How to prepare the input data for the algorithm to use it;
    \item \alert{Input Size}: Relationship between input size, algorithm, and program speed;
    \item \alert{Special Cases}: Difficult Input Data that causes bugs;
    \item \alert{Debugging}: How to find bugs by yourself;
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Automated Judging (AJ)}
  \begin{exampleblock}{}
  In this lecture we use {\bf Automated Judges (AJ)} to check if your homework is correct.
  \end{exampleblock}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item An AJ receives a program, and evaluate if the output is correct;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ex: AtCoder, Aizu Online Judge, Topcoder, Codeforces, etc.
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    \item The AJ tests your program with a set of {\bfTest Cases} (Hidden Input Data)\bigskip

    \item The AJ gives a result: \structure{Correct} or \alert{Incorrect}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When the result is incorrect, \alert{it does not say the reason}.
      \item You have to debug the program yourself (crate tests case!);
      \item After you debug the program, you can submit again;
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What this class expects of you}
  \begin{exampleblock}{}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You have basic programming knowledge (C++, Java or Python);
      \begin{itemize}
      \item If you don't know how to program, this class will be very hard.
      \end{itemize}
      \medskip

    \item To pass the course, you need to do homework every week;
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Average of 4 hours of study / week;
        \item A lot of time on debugging;
        \item (Atcoder difficulty: 300 to 500)
      \end{itemize}
      \medskip

      \item Homework starts easy, but becomes harder later in the course;
      \medskip

      \item No final exam.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exampleblock}
  \hfill {\bf Hint: Do your homework early!}
\end{frame}

\subsection{What are Programming Challenges?}
\begin{frame}{Homework: What are Programming Challenges?}

  It is a puzzle that you solve by writing a program.
  \bigskip

  The program reads the input, and must write the correct output.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Difficulty 1: The output must be \alert{exactly} correct.
  \item Difficulty 2: The test input is \alert{not known}.
  \item Difficulty 3: There is a maximum \alert{execution time}.
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  In general, a correct program will be small (< 200 lines).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: The 3n+1 problem}{What is the problem?}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.55\textwidth}
    {\smaller
    The problem wants the \structure{longest sequence size} generated by the following algorithm:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $n = 1$ then STOP
        \item if $n$ is odd, then $n = 3n + 1$
        \item else $n = n/2$
        \item GOTO 1
      \end{enumerate}
    \medskip

    For example, if $i = 1$ and $j = 4$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item n = 1: 1 END; {\bf Length 1}
      \item n = 2: 2 1 END; {\bf Length 2}
      \item n = 3: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 END; {\bf Length 8}
      \item n = 4: 4 2 1 END; {\bf Length 3}
    \end{itemize}
    So the {\bf maximum length} is 8 (for n = 3)}

int main() {

  for (int a = min; a <= max; i++) {           // Loop from i to j
    int cycle = 1;               
    int n = a;
    while (n != 1) {
      if (n % 2 == 0) { n = n / 2; }           // calculate n
      else { n = n*3 + 1; }
      cycle++;                                 // increase cycle size
    }
    if (cycle > maxcycle) maxcycle = cycle;    // keep max cycle
  }
  cout << min << " " << max << " " << maxcycle << "\n";
  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: The 3n+1 problem}{Simple programs, simple
  problems}

If you try to run this program with large inputs, it will be very slow! Why?
\bigskip

Consider the inputs: i = 1, j = 10:
\begin{itemize}
  \item n = 1: 1 END
  \item n = 2: 2 1 END
  ...
  \item n = 7: 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 END\\
  ...
  \item n = 9: 9 28 14 \alert{7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 END}
  \item n = 10: \alert{10 5 16 8 4 2 1 END}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

There is a lot of repetition!  How to make the program faster?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: The 3n+1 problem}{Memoization}
  We use \alert{Memoization} to make the program faster
  \bigskip

  {\bf Memoization}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Every time you finish a calculation, store the result in the memory;
    \item Before you begin a calculation, check if the result is not in the memory;
  \end{itemize}
  \bigskip

  This technique can reduce the amount of repeated work.
  \bigskip

  In this course we will review and study many techniques like this one.\\
  You will have to implement these techniques in the homework to make it efficient.

\begin{frame}{Why programming challenges?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf For Competitions}: Competitive programming started around
    1980 in the US. Today, many universities in the world compete,
    including Tsukuba.
