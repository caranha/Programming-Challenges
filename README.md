These are the lecture notes for the "Programming Challenges" undergraduate
class at the University of Tsukuba.

# Course Outline:
In this course, we study several algorithms by solving programming competition
style challenges. The mail goal is to improve our programming skill and
algorithm knowledge through implementation.
