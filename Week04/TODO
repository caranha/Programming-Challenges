# Week 3 TODO

- Explain the difference between Top-Down and Bottom up 
  DP better. Students are used to Top-Down (Memoization) DP.
- Bottom up DP is more work, but can be used on infinite 
  memory problems (keeping only part of the table)
- Use blue background for code, white background is hard to see

## Class 1
- Intro to DP, three main examples
- Extra examples - coins example should probably come 
  right after subset sum because it is simpler
- Use more DP tables on each explanation.
