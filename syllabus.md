# Programming Challenges Syllabus (GB21802)

## Basic Data:
- 2 credits, 3rd and 4th year,
- Spring AB, Tue 3,4
- **Lecturer**: Claus Aranha
- **Class Type**: Lecture

## Outline:
We will study several algorithms using programming challenges. This lecture is
focused on programming and implementation. Main topics: Dynamic Programming,
Graphs, Data Structures, String Manipulation, Computational Geometry, etc.

## Competences:
- General Competences:
  - (2) Critical and Creative thinking
  - (4) Wide perspective and internationality
- Specific Competences:
  - (2) Software Science Knowledge
  - (6) Problem Solving and Practical Skills
  - (7) Ethics in Computer Sciences

## Educational Objectives
The goal of this course is to learn how to identify the necessary algorithm to
solve a given program, and how to correctly implement it. This course aims at
giving a practical view of previously learned algorithms and programming
techniques.

## Keywords:
Algorithms, Programming, Problem Solving, Programming Contests

## Lecture Plan
1. Course Introduction - What are programming contests? - Introductory Problems	 	 
2. Data Structures:1D Vector, 2D Vector, Sets, Tree Structures, UFDS	 	 
3. Search Methods: Full Search, Binary Search, Greedy Search	 	 
4. Dynamic Programming: Grid Search, MaxSum, LIS, MaxSum, TSP	 	 
5. Graph I:Graph Structure, BFS, DFS, Flood Fill, TopoSort, Spanning Tree	 	 
6. Graph II:Shortest Paths, Flow	 	 
7. Mathematics: Number Theory, Combinatoric Problems	 	 
8. Geometry: Lines, Angles, Circles, Triangles, Polygons	 	 
9. Strings: String Matching, Edit Distance, Suffix Array	 	 
10. Final Remix: Problems using multiple of the algorithms studies in this course.	 	 

## Course Requirements
Basic programming concepts (Compiling, loops, if-then-else operators, etc.) [C, C++ or Java]

## Evaluation Criteria
This course does not implement a final examination. The evaluation is based on weekly programming assignments.

## Study time and expected work outside the classroom:
The student must complete at least 2 short programming assignments every week (out of 8 possible choices). To achieve an "A" grade, the student must complete at least 4 programming assignments per week.
